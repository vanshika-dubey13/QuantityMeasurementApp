# QuantityMeasurementApp

> A Java application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and refine a quantity measurement system. The project emphasizes incremental development, clean object-oriented design, and continuous refactoring to build a flexible and maintainable domain model over time.

# 📖 Overview

- Modular Java project focused on modelling quantity measurements.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases to evolve the domain design.
- Emphasizes clarity, consistency, and maintainable structure as the system grows.

# ✅ Implemented Features

> Features will be added here as Use Cases are implemented.
- 🧩 UC1 – Feet Equality
> - Implements value-based equality for feet measurements using an overridden equals() method.
> - Establishes object equality semantics as the foundation for future unit comparisons.

- 🧩 UC2 – Inches Equality :
> - Extends value-based equality comparison to inches measurements using a dedicated Inches class.
> - Maintains independent unit validation while reinforcing equality behaviour across measurement types.

- 🧩 UC3 – Generic Length :
> - Refactors unit-specific classes into a unified Length abstraction using a LengthUnit enum.
> - Eliminates duplicated logic by applying the DRY principle while enabling cross-unit equality comparison.

- 🧩 UC4 – Extended Unit Support :
> - Adds Yards and Centimeters to the LengthUnit enum with appropriate conversion factors.
> - Demonstrates scalability of the generic design by enabling seamless cross-unit equality without introducing new classes.

- 🧩 UC5 – Unit-to-Unit Conversion :
> - Introduces explicit conversion operations between supported length units using centralized enum conversion factors.
> - Extends the Length API to convert measurements across units while preserving mathematical equivalence and precision.

- 🧩 UC6 – Length Addition Operation :
> - Introduces addition between length measurements with automatic unit normalization and conversion.
> - Returns a new immutable Length result expressed in the unit of the first operand while preserving mathematical accuracy.

- 🧩 UC7 – Addition with Target Unit Specification :
> - Extends length addition to allow explicit specification of the result unit independent of operand units.
> - Enhances API flexibility by enabling arithmetic results to be expressed in any supported unit while preserving immutability and precision.

- 🧩 UC8 – Standalone Unit Refactor :
> - Extracts LengthUnit into a standalone enum responsible for all unit conversion logic.
> - Improves architectural separation by delegating conversions to units, reducing coupling and enabling scalable support for future measurement categories.

- 🧩 UC9 – Weight Measurement Support :
> - Introduces a weight measurement category with Weight and WeightUnit supporting kilograms, grams, and pounds.
> - Enables equality, conversion, and addition operations for weight while preserving strict separation from length measurements and stabilizing the shared measurement architecture.

# ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

> - Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
> - Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
> - Each Use Case introduces new functionality in small, controlled steps.
> - Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
> - Design evolves toward clean, maintainable, and well-tested software.

# QuantityMeasurementApp

> A Java application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and refine a quantity measurement system. The project emphasizes incremental development, clean object-oriented design, and continuous refactoring to build a flexible and maintainable domain model over time.

# 📖 Overview

- Modular Java project focused on modelling quantity measurements.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases to evolve the domain design.
- Emphasizes clarity, consistency, and maintainable structure as the system grows.

# ✅ Implemented Features

> Features will be added here as Use Cases are implemented.
- 🧩 UC1 – Feet Equality
> - Implements value-based equality for feet measurements using an overridden equals() method.
> - Establishes object equality semantics as the foundation for future unit comparisons.

- 🧩 UC2 – Inches Equality :
> - Extends value-based equality comparison to inches measurements using a dedicated Inches class.
> - Maintains independent unit validation while reinforcing equality behaviour across measurement types.

- 🧩 UC3 – Generic Length :
> - Refactors unit-specific classes into a unified Length abstraction using a LengthUnit enum.
> - Eliminates duplicated logic by applying the DRY principle while enabling cross-unit equality comparison.

- 🧩 UC4 – Extended Unit Support :
> - Adds Yards and Centimeters to the LengthUnit enum with appropriate conversion factors.
> - Demonstrates scalability of the generic design by enabling seamless cross-unit equality without introducing new classes.

- 🧩 UC5 – Unit-to-Unit Conversion :
> - Introduces explicit conversion operations between supported length units using centralized enum conversion factors.
> - Extends the Length API to convert measurements across units while preserving mathematical equivalence and precision.

- 🧩 UC6 – Length Addition Operation :
> - Introduces addition between length measurements with automatic unit normalization and conversion.
> - Returns a new immutable Length result expressed in the unit of the first operand while preserving mathematical accuracy.

- 🧩 UC7 – Addition with Target Unit Specification :
> - Extends length addition to allow explicit specification of the result unit independent of operand units.
> - Enhances API flexibility by enabling arithmetic results to be expressed in any supported unit while preserving immutability and precision.

- 🧩 UC8 – Standalone Unit Refactor :
> - Extracts LengthUnit into a standalone enum responsible for all unit conversion logic.
> - Improves architectural separation by delegating conversions to units, reducing coupling and enabling scalable support for future measurement categories.

- 🧩 UC9 – Weight Measurement Support :
> - Introduces a weight measurement category with Weight and WeightUnit supporting kilograms, grams, and pounds.
> - Enables equality, conversion, and addition operations for weight while preserving strict separation from length measurements and stabilizing the shared measurement architecture.

- 🧩 UC10 – Generic Quantity Architecture :
> - Introduces a generic Quantity<U extends IMeasurable> model enabling multiple measurement categories through a shared abstraction.
> - Eliminates category-specific duplication by unifying equality, conversion, and addition logic into a single scalable architecture.

- 🧩 UC11 – Volume Measurement Support :
> - Adds a new measurement category using VolumeUnit (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon) implemented through the generic Quantity<U> architecture.
> - Validates that new measurement types integrate without modifying existing quantity logic, proving true multi-category scalability.

- 🧩 UC12 – Subtraction and Division Operations :
> - Introduces subtraction between quantities with automatic cross-unit normalization while preserving immutability.
> - Adds division support producing a dimensionless ratio, enabling comparative analysis across measurements of the same category.

- 🧩 UC13 – Centralized Arithmetic Logic (DRY Refactor) :
> - Refactors addition, subtraction, and division to use a centralized arithmetic helper, eliminating duplicated validation and conversion logic.
> - Improves maintainability and scalability while preserving all existing behaviour and public APIs.

- 🧩 UC14 – Temperature Measurement (Selective Arithmetic Support) :
> - Introduces temperature measurements using TemperatureUnit integrated into the generic Quantity<U> architecture.
> - Supports equality comparison and unit conversion across Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using non-linear conversion formulas.
> - Refactors IMeasurable with default capability validation to allow category-specific operation support.
> - Prevents unsupported arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division) through explicit validation and meaningful exceptions.
> - Demonstrates Interface Segregation and capability-based design while preserving backward compatibility for length, weight, and volume.

- 🧩 UC15 – N-Tier Architecture Refactoring :
> - Refactors the Quantity Measurement Application from a monolithic design into a structured N-Tier architecture.
> - Introduces layered separation including Controller, Service, Repository, Model, Entity, DTO, Interfaces, and Units packages.
> - Moves business logic into the Service layer, while the Controller layer manages application interaction and orchestration.
> - Adds a Repository layer with a cache-based storage implementation to record measurement operations.
> - Standardizes data flow using QuantityDTO for external transfer, QuantityModel for internal processing, and QuantityMeasurementEntity for persistence.
> - Improves modularity, testability, maintainability, and extensibility, preparing the system for future integration with REST APIs or database storage.

- 🧩 UC16 – Database Integration with JDBC for Quantity Measurement Persistence :
> - Extends the N-Tier architecture established in UC15 with persistent relational database storage using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
> - Introduces QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository as a full JDBC-based replacement for the in-memory QuantityMeasurementCacheRepository, enabling long-term data persistence across application restarts.
> - Adds ApplicationConfig utility class that loads all database configuration from application.properties, supporting environment-specific settings for development, testing, and production.
> - Introduces ConnectionPool utility class that manages a pool of reusable JDBC connections for efficient resource usage, eliminating the overhead of opening and closing connections on every operation.
> - Extends IQuantityMeasurementRepository interface with four new methods: getMeasurementsByOperation(), getMeasurementsByType(), getTotalCount(), and deleteAll() — enabling filtering, reporting, and test isolation.
> - Adds DatabaseException to the custom exception hierarchy, with static factory methods (connectionFailed, queryFailed, transactionFailed) for structured, meaningful database error handling.
> - Adopts parameterized SQL queries (PreparedStatement) throughout the database repository to prevent SQL injection attacks.
> - Migrates all System.out.println logging to Java's built-in java.util.logging (JUL) framework via SLF4J and Logback for structured, configurable output across all layers.
> - Reorganizes packages from com.apps.quantitymeasurement.* to com.app.quantitymeasurement.* with clear layer-based sub-packages: controller, service, repository, entity, exception, unit, and util.
> - Uses H2 embedded database by default (zero external setup required) with the ability to switch to MySQL or PostgreSQL by updating application.properties and uncommenting the relevant pom.xml dependency.
> - Adds schema.sql under src/main/resources/db/ defining the quantity_measurement_entity table and an audit quantity_measurement_history table with proper indexes for query performance.
> - Repository type is fully configurable at runtime via the repository.type property (database or cache) — no code changes needed to switch persistence strategies.
> - Adds integration tests (QuantityMeasurementIntegrationTest) and unit tests for each layer — repository, service, and controller — using H2 in-memory database for fast, isolated test execution.
> - Implements closeResources() and deleteAllMeasurements() methods on QuantityMeasurementApp for graceful shutdown and test state management.
> - Demonstrates enterprise-level practices including connection pooling, transaction awareness, resource cleanup with try-finally, separation of configuration from code, and environment-specific database profiles.

# ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

> - Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
> - Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
> - Each Use Case introduces new functionality in small, controlled steps.
> - Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
> - Design evolves toward clean, maintainable, and well-tested software.

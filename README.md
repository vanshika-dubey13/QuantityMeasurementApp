# QuantityMeasurementApp

> A Java application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and refine a quantity measurement system. The project emphasizes incremental development, clean object-oriented design, and continuous refactoring to build a flexible and maintainable domain model over time.

# 📖 Overview

- Modular Java project focused on modelling quantity measurements.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases to evolve the domain design.
- Emphasizes clarity, consistency, and maintainable structure as the system grows.

# ✅ Implemented Features

> Features will be added here as Use Cases are implemented.
- 🧩 UC1 – Feet Equality
> - Implements value-based equality for feet measurements using an overridden equals() method.
> - Establishes object equality semantics as the foundation for future unit comparisons.

- 🧩 UC2 – Inches Equality :
> - Extends value-based equality comparison to inches measurements using a dedicated Inches class.
> - Maintains independent unit validation while reinforcing equality behaviour across measurement types.

# 🧰 Tech Stack

> Java 17+ — core language and application development
> Maven — build automation and dependency management
> JUnit 5 — unit testing framework supporting TDD workflow

# ▶️ Build / Run

>  Build the project:
> - mvn clean install

> Run tests:
> - mvn test

# ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

> - Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
> - Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
> - Each Use Case introduces new functionality in small, controlled steps.
> - Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
> - Design evolves toward clean, maintainable, and well-tested software.

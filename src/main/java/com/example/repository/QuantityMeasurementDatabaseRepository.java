/**
 * QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository
 *
 * This class implements the IQuantityMeasurementRepository interface and provides methods
 * to interact with a relational database for storing and retrieving quantity measurement
 * data. It uses JDBC for database operations and a connection pool for efficient resource
 * management. The repository handles CRUD operations for QuantityMeasurementEntity objects
 * and includes methods to query measurements by operation type and measurement type. It
 * also includes error handling using a custom DatabaseException to encapsulate any
 * database-related issues. The repository is designed to be used by the service layer of
 * the application to persist the results of quantity measurement operations and to
 * retrieve historical data for analysis and reporting. It ensures that database connections
 * are properly managed and that resources are released after use to prevent leaks and ensure
 * optimal performance.

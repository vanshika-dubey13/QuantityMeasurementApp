/**
 * DatabaseException
 *
 * DatabaseException is thrown when database operations fail.
 * This exception encapsulates JDBC errors and provides meaningful context
 * for upper layers of the application.
 *
 * Extends QuantityMeasurementException so it participates in the application's
 * custom exception hierarchy. Upper layers can catch DatabaseException specifically
 * or catch QuantityMeasurementException more broadly as needed.
 *
 * Provides static factory methods for common failure scenarios:
 * - connectionFailed: when database connectivity cannot be established
 * - queryFailed:      when a SQL query execution fails
 * - transactionFailed: when a transaction cannot complete
 *
